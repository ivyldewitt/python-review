# Introduction

My current projects and review for the "Python for Absolute Beginners" course on TalkPython. I may also store a few other notes here that I learn from other sessions, but the majority of work will be from there.

For those interested, course link: [Talk Python â€“ Python for Absolute Beginners](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/python-for-absolute-beginners).

I will also be sure to note any changes or updates here as I go, or list out other course I take. Will likely store this for "most" repo info.
