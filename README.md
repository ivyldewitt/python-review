# Introduction

My current projects and review for the "Python for Absolute Beginners" course on TalkPython. I may also store a few other notes here that I learn from other sessions, but the majority of work will be from there.

For those interested, course link: [Talk Python â€“ Python for Absolute Beginners](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/python-for-absolute-beginners).

I will also be sure to note any changes or updates here as I go, or list out other course I take. Will likely store this for "most" repo info.

## Chapters 1-8

Throughout my progress in this course, one of the primary things to note is that coding is a modular process. Yes, there are situations and instances when you should be actively focusing on tackling the larger process at hand, but learning the building blocks and knowing when to _apply information to these building blocks_ is extremely important. 

Having the inclination to see that things like lists, dictionaries, and sets are the components from what we can use to make a larger, more coherent set of processes. It doens't haven't to be amazingly complicated nor do you have to stay at a blank piece of code endlessly. Use this information to build and improve your skills and comprehension.

More notes referencing that are in the `tictactoe.py` code, but this is my main takeaware from working on these initial chapters.
